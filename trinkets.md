The Web is full of things that are much cooler and more interesting than this blog! Here I've listed some fun websites and software I've found around the web.
1. [**All Roads Lead to Philosophy**](https://www.xefer.com/wikipedia)
    - If you click on the first link in a Wikipedia article, it takes you to another article. If you continue to click on the first link on each page you visit, you'll probably end up at [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy). There's even [a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) about the phenomenon.
