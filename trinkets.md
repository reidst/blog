The Web is full of things that are much cooler and more interesting than this blog! Here I've listed some fun websites and software I've found around the web.
1. [**All Roads Lead to Philosophy**](https://www.xefer.com/wikipedia)
    - If you click on the first link in a Wikipedia article, it takes you to another article. If you continue to click on the first link on each page you visit, you'll probably end up at [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy). There's even [a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) about the phenomenon.
2. [**The Hello World Collection**](http://helloworldcollection.de/)
    - Ever wondered how to say `hello, world` in the most esoteric or archaic programming languages? The Hello World Collection is a library of hundreds of Hello World programs in all sorts of languages, from [ActionScript](http://helloworldcollection.de/#ActionScript%C2%A03.0) to [Zig](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Zig).
3. [**Is It Bandcamp Friday?**](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/)
    - Is today the best day to support your favorite independent musical artists? Use this handy tool to find out! TL;DR: Bandcamp waives its revenue share of purchases made on the first Friday of the month.
