Hi! I'm Simon Reid, a computer science student at Hendrix College and part of the graduating class of 2025.

I like just about anything to do with computers, but especially:
- video game design & development
- graphics programming
- language processing & interpreting
- competitive programming

I also like teaching people. I've been a TA at Hendrix ever since my second semester, and I hope to be a professor of math or computer science someday. For now, I hope I can use this blog to educate and provide insight about the things I'm learning and doing as an undergraduate student.

This blog covers topics such as:
- my time working for [Disco Tray Studios](https://discotraystudios.github.io)
- my coursework for [CSCI 340 Database and Web Systems](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340)

I am [reidst](https://github.com/reidst/) on GitHub - check out my latest projects!
